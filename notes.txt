Building, execute this line before building-
date +%-y,%-m,%-d,0,%-k,%-M,%-S > ${ProjectDir}/now.h
so any rtc setting can include now.h at point of datetime_t setting


for debug filenames (out to uart)-
to get filename with only basename, just create a constant with the name in the source file
static const char* m_filename = "UsbCdcAcm.cpp";
since __FILE__ will be the name (including path) provided to the compiler (we don't want it all)
and all other ways to get only the basename are ugly and may /may not work or still bring in the whole __FILE_ string
